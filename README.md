# 1st JavaScript challenge

This assignment was the introduction to Javascript. Moving from only a slight knowledge of Html and CSS to creating a fully functional application with multiple functions and events that use user input was a challenging task. If you need a password 8 to 128 characters and cant think of it on your own, this password generator is perfect for you and meets specific criteria that most webpages require today.
